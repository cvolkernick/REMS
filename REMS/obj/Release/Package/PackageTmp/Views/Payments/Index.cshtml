<h2>Payments</h2>

<p>
    Digital payments offer your clientele the convenience of paying rent, bills, and other expenses without the hassle of physical exchange of payment.
    This also has the positive side effect of freeing up staff from processing these payments (collection, bank deposits, etc.). The added
    convenience increases likelihood of on-time payments, which can further be improved with automatic scheduled payment processing.
